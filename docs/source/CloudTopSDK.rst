CloudTopSDK
********

The CloudTopSDK is a tool that assists the user in building docker images which include application software and are based on the CloudTop (https://helxplatform.github.io/cloudtop-docs/) docker.  Use of this tool has several advantages: 1) the user does not need to to be an expert in building docker images 2) the user does not need to know anything about how to interface with CloudTops process management and initialization architecture and 3) the development time required to produce an application specific image is reduced. Future plans include adding the capacity to build the images with a specified tag and push these images to repositories such as GitHub.
